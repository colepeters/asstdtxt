This is an ongoing collection of writing by [Cole Peters](//colepeters.com).

I am a photographer doing web development during the day. Occasionally I record music too.

I started this site to break away from [my blog](//blog.colepeters.com), which was becoming too messy and random for my liking. My intentions for this site are to focus more on personal writing, and to make space for more words on photography. There won’t be any web development-related posts filed here (there may be more of those posted on the blog).

Thanks for visiting. Let’s see how this goes.
