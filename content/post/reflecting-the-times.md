What follows is something of a year-end introspection, with an (eventual) focus on my photography.
<!--more-->

I have mixed feelings about the past 11 months of my life and personal work. This has been an awful year for much of the world. No wonder [John Oliver concluded the season of Last Week Tonight with a big ‘Fuck you!’ to 2016][1]. As a straight white cis male living on a decent income, my hardships pale in comparison to those of almost any other variety of person. Still, 2016 has taken its toll on me.

Shifting my career into web development has been a challenge — a rewarding one, true, but I’m not yet sure if the rewards outweigh the costs. Post-Brexit, I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time worrying about my wife’s safety and, together with her, questioning our place in the UK. My maternal grandmother passed away this year, and being an ocean away from family made her passing difficult to weather — especially in not being able to support my mother and loved ones in person, and having to witness their grief from afar. I spent one of the most traumatic nights in recent memory with Anna in the hospital, while she suffered through a fractured arm and a severe concussion from a riding accident. The list goes on. On top of all this, I’ve had mixed results attempting to taper off my now 10-year history with antidepressants. In retrospect, this may have been the worst possible year for me to consider doing so.

But then there’s the photography.

Outside of my marriage and family, photography has proven to be one of the sole sources of refuge and reward for me in 2016. I self-published my first two books of photographs this year. The first one bombed (though my family and friends say they like it). The second one did a bit better. I managed to get 16 of my prints shown at a camera store here in London, marking my first exhibit since my first show in 2008 (back home in Winnipeg). I tried my hand at a couple more photography competitions. My entry didn’t make the cut in the first one, and for some reason I’m anticipating a second rejection shortly, but they’ve both been good exercises in editing and refining my images (both individually and as selections).

Perhaps most importantly, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking critically about my work, attempting to hone in on its essence, to strengthen my vision, to clarify my intent.

This is where I turn to a video of Nina Simone that’s been making the rounds lately.

For the bulk of the last two years, I’ve turned my lens to the streets of the city and the people who walk them. ‘Street photography’ is a term I’ve grown tired of — though I understand the intent, as a closed construct it borders on meaninglessness. But I appreciate and embrace the spirit of attempting to create resonance out of chaos, and this is what has drawn my lens towards public life as a subject these past years. What I’ve discovered through photographing in public, however, is an attachment to subjects which, as Ms Simone phrases it, reflect the times.

I’ve attended a number of protests since my arrival in London, but the first which I photographed in earnest was [the anti-austerity protest of June, 2015][2]. The photographs I made on that day hinted at a certain potency and emotive quality I’d been searching for but rarely found in my more aimless wanderings through the city. Alongside these qualities came a sense of purpose. I don’t believe the photograph is beholden to any purpose beyond its existence as an aesthetic document, but as a person, the sensation that my work was somehow connecting me to something greater than myself felt magnetic. The plight of those tens of thousands of people who had gathered to expose the impact of economic austerity measures on their lives was potent, moving. As a photographer I had the ability to both witness and amplify these sentiments through my work. In some small way, I felt able to help — to not just create aesthetic documents, but to use them as a form of aid.

I continued my more general ‘street’ work, but other protests followed. In September of 2015, [a march in solidarity with refugees][3]. In July of 2016, [a protest in the wake of Brexit][4]. The following October, [a demonstration by Polish women facing the loss of their reproductive rights][5]. The [United Families and Friends Campaign annual rally][6] for people who’ve died in state custody. Last week’s [protest of government cuts to UK domestic violence services][7], organised by Sisters Uncut. A local community meeting held four days ago, addressing the rise of racism and xenophobia in the UK. With each event I attended and photographed, the more I felt compelled to use my photography as a social tool.

We live in troubling times. This goes double for people of colour, women, the LGBTQ+ community, migrants, and almost everyone else who is not an upper-to-middle-class straight white male living in a Western society. Taking into account the colour of my skin, my gender, my sexual orientation and my (relative) financial self-sufficiency, it is almost always a given that those attending political events such as those that I’ve photographed lack a measure of cultural and economic privilege that I do not.

In considering these facts, Nina Simone’s question — ‘How can you not reflect the times?’ — struck home for me immediately upon hearing it. Given the state of the world, how can I _not_ attempt to use what skills and abilities I have in an effort to amplify the message of those who, in these times, are at risk of getting trampled underfoot? In short: how I can deny the chance to put my privilege to good use for once?

The answer for me seems clear: I cannot.

I do not believe that photography can change the world. The only things to have ever changed the world are living creatures and natural events (whether global or stellar). I have no illusions of reversing global warming, equalising the status of all humans, or generally bringing about world peace with my photographs.

But that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t attempt to put my photographs to work in the service of those less fortunate than myself. It doesn’t mean I don’t hope to make some sort of beneficial impact with my efforts.

There’s another, more selfish side to all this, I’ll admit.

Documenting and attempting to amplify causes which centre on the plight of disadvantaged groups makes me feel good.

Let me be clear with this statement: I don’t attend events like the Sisters Uncut march or the UFFC rally with a smile on my face, nor does my work at such events make me feel smug or accomplished. When I photograph a woman describing how the police murdered her brother, my thoughts aren’t focused on feeling good about myself. When I attempt to draw attention to the immigration raids in London’s East End through my photographs, it’s not for want of being a good white boy. I do not suggest that my efforts should vindicate me of the negative biases I no doubt still possess, nor do they inherently make me a ‘good ally’. I do not want to portray the classic image of the white photojournalist swooping in to save the day with his camera (gross).

Instead, when I say that this sort of photography makes me feel good, what I’m referring to is the sense of having placed my energies somewhere worthwhile. Of using the time available to me and the skills I’ve endeavoured to refine in the service of something greater than myself.

_(Sidenote: I recently watched [a presentation of Larry Towell’s photography][8] — his words and images strike me as relevant to this subject.)_

How this all plays out is a question I need to think further about. Photographing protests might be a good start, but I feel it is just that: a place to begin. The task before me now is to consider what comes next. It’s a tough question, but also one that kindles my spirit.

I plan on keeping my approach to photography loose and amenable to change, but as a guiding principle, this is the approach I see it taking for 2017. It’s obviously not one that will make sense for all photographers, but it makes sense for me. It feels right for me.

That small sense of purpose is something I hope to latch on to, and to ride out for all it’s worth.

_Postscript: While I still don’t consider myself a storyteller, it is interesting to note the difference a month can make. In [a previous post][9], I asserted that ‘I have no points to make. I have no agendas to push. No opinions to mould.’ Maybe I’ll find some agenda to push after all._
