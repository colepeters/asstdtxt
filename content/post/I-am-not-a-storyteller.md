I am a photographer. I do not tell stories. I do not attempt to make sense of the world. I embrace the chaos. I ensnare the chaos. Bottle it up in a sequence of frames.

I present my lens’s portrayals of encounters as imaged by the camera.

[Jeanloup Sieff claimed][1] photographers ‘are not responsible for what people feel in front of our images’ and I concur. I often feel that I am barely responsible for my images themselves. Entropy wields far more control over my photographs than I do. I select the moment of exposure and the positioning of my lens. Though even the framing is something I attempt to subvert. The subjects captured within the resultant frame are beyond my control. Their arrangement within time and space is beyond my influence. Perhaps the most authority I might wield over a photograph is the choice to display it and the resolving of its aesthetic problems. I am again reminded of Sieff, who said ‘Even superficiality is not a notion that I reject. I am totally superficial, I know. But I believe superficiality can be very serious…’

I seek to question, not to answer. And even then, I may not care to clarify the question itself.

I have no points to make. I have no agendas to push. No opinions to mould. No stories to tell.

I have only photographs. Let that be enough.
