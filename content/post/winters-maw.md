Snow is falling on Lake Winnipeg, from an endless sky to an endless expanse of ice, both dove grey in late afternoon light, diffused and fading slowly to dusk. We force a smile because Grandmother lives in the hospital now, will live there for a while, bound to the morphine drip, dulling the pain.

The Christmas dinner her daughter was preparing for her sits half-baked on the counter, future now uncertain. Time moves towards a stillness mimicking the lake beyond the window, a frozen skin concealing the life shifting glacially somewhere below.

I hear a tick-tick-ticking from one room over, and I nearly turn to see Maisy trotting towards me, but she died some months ago and it’s just the sound of Winter’s maw seizing the frame of the house, compressing the timbres and us inside it, while jazz croons on the stereo and the world outside recasts to black.
