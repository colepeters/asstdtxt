[Is Instagram the death or saviour of photography?][1] It’s neither. And it’s certainly not ‘more radical’ than the invention of photography itself.

Instagram is just more photography.

There’s something disconcerting about the way the above-linked article breathlessly drops sentences like, ‘After nearly 200 years, photography is realising its potential’ — as if no event in the history of photography has made more of an impact than the emergence of a mobile app to snap and share pictures. The statement verges on insulting.

This is not to take away from Instagram’s success. With a user base of [more than 500 million people][2], it is certainly a behemoth in terms of photo-centric social media. But at a mere 5 years old, it’s a droplet in photography’s ocean of history, and certainly not one substantial enough to ‘kill’ or ‘save’ photography itself.

Unfortunately, articles such as these present textbook cases of false premise. Photography is not at death’s doorstep. There is nothing about photography that needs saving.

Instagram is not ‘disrupting’ photography. It is a logical extension of photography’s place in society — nothing more and nothing less than a monetised social platform based around the photograph as content. In this sense it is nearly indistinct from any other forum for the exhibition of photographs (albeit with a larger audience and selection of exhibitors than most).

It should therefore not surprise us that much of the photographs shared on Instagram could arguably be considered disposable at best, or that gems of photographic work exist alongside those less interesting snapshots. It’s [Sturgeon’s law][3] in action.
