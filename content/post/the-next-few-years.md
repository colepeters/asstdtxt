I’ve just finished filling out a questionnaire about a series of my photographs. One of the questions asked, ‘What are your goals for your photography over the next few years?’. It’s an interesting question for me. My goals have changed so much since I first got serious about photography.

I experimented with taking photos throughout my teenage years, but waited until 2006 to enrol in a college education for professional photography. I soon discovered a love of fashion photography — the more experimental and avant-garde, the better. It wasn’t long before I was dreaming about having my work appear in the pages of Italian or French Vogue. Bold ideas for a 20-something photographer from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

With such grand plans in mind, I established a photography practice after graduating college. It only lasted a few months, in part because Winnipeg had zero commercial interest in a photographer fancying himself the next [Paolo Roversi][1] but not least due to my unwillingness to work more menial gigs just to pay my bills.

I started working a day job. In my personal time I continued working towards producing edgy fashion and portraiture. Part of me still hoped to appear in the glossy magazines. This isn’t to suggest that artistic development wasn’t important to me (in this regard I was unwavering, even if it meant financial burden), but I wanted more. I wanted renown. I wanted respect. I’m not sure I ever knew to what end.

I took a hiatus from photography in 2012 to switch gears and work in design (another long-standing interest). It wasn’t until 2015 that I picked up a camera again. Since diving back into photography — still on a personal basis — I’ve found myself working towards a very different agenda.

Perhaps age has tempered my desires, made me more reflective. It’s not that I have no want of prestige, but there are bigger motivations now. The way I find myself working now, I am my most important critic. What is crucial to me as a photographer right now is refining my voice, producing work that I can be confident in and proud of. The challenge here is that I am also my worst critic, and so measuring up is easier said than done.

Over the past year especially, I’ve been doing a great amount of studying those photographers whom I consider to be masters of their craft — [Frank][2], [Koudelka][3], [Winogrand][4] and [Larry Towell][5], for example. In doing so, I’ve discovered a thread common to most photographers I look up to: the desire to give voice to something deep inside them. That ‘something’ might be indescribable or it might be concrete, but what matters is satisfying this personal imperative first. Frank and Winogrand embody this approach for me. Both their artistic voices are uncompromising. Each have dedicated themselves to expressing a singular vision, whether art critics, photography editors, publishers or the general public give a damn or not. (And yet, most of those parties named have since given quite a few damns.)

So I return to the question. What are my goals for my photography over the next few years?

I want to become a better photographer. The work I’ve produced over the past two years, the past 6 months in particular, is work that I’m proud of. But I there is still much to improve. I’ve picked up signs and smells of what I want to do more of, and I’ve learned what I don’t want to do anymore. Over the next few years, I want to continue to hone in on that singular vision, to give rise to that artistic voice, to feed what is still an urgent desire to examine and question the world around me through photography.

I’m not working towards becoming famous. I’m producing photo books, and I’m hoping to follow up my small exhibit of prints this year with more exhibitions, but neither of these is about making a mark. Each time I work on a project meant for public consumption (even if the consumption is lean), I find myself circling closer to what matters most to me in my work — that which makes it mine. That’s what’s important. Would I throw a party if Steidl decided to pick up my latest book, or if I could make it into the leagues of Magnum? Of course. But that’s not the aim.

The aim, right now, is to stoke that fire that demands I look at the world, to question it, to capture it, and then to look and question and capture it again.

I just want to make work that is fulfilling. The rest, at this point, is noise.
